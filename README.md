A set of ansible roles to use with Vagrant to build simple gluster lab .
========================================================================


What you'll need.
----------------

A Vagrant Rhel 7 box. I have prepared a few boxes and you can download them here:

Alternatively you can use Vagrantize to create an Atomic Host Vagrant box yourself.



Instructions
------------

Clone this repository.
Edit the Vagrantfile to reflect the names you gave your boxes.

```
vagrant up 
```
