A set of ansible roles to use with Vagrant to build smiple labs.
================================================================


What you'll need.
----------------

A Vagrant Rhel 7 box, and a Vagrant  Atomic Host box. I have prepared a few boxes and you can download them here:

Alternatively you can use Vagrantize to create an Atomic Host Vagrant box yourself.



Instructions
------------

Clone this repository.
Edit the Vagrantfile to reflect the names you gave your boxes.

```
vagrant up 
```
